The objective of this exercise is to understand the factors that drive higher incidence of financial firms in a geographic region. Use the datasets, shrug_rbi, shrug_pc11 and shrug_secc to understand:
What is the average access indicator: typically measured as number of bank branches per 10000 persons across India? 
Assign villages/towns as below average and above average (Average is term used loosely here, please feel free to use a better classification definition that incorporates a relative measure of access (Stick to binary response for the purposes of this exercise)
Identify explanatory variables to from shrug_pc11 and shrug_secc build into your model. Explain your choices
Build one (or more) logistic regression model on a training dataset (use 80:20split)
Predict the response for the test dataset and assess the accuracy of the model. Give your inference 
Run the same model using LDA and KNN and compare the results
